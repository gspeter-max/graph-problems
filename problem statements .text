Graph Coloring Problem:
1. Given a graph and M colors, can you color each vertex so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color?


2. 🔍 Hamiltonian Path Finder in a Graph
📖 Problem Statement
Given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency matrix, your task is to determine whether there exists a Hamiltonian Path in the graph. A Hamiltonian Path is a path that visits every vertex exactly once. If such a path exists, output one valid Hamiltonian Path. Otherwise, state that no path exists.

📊 Input
An integer N representing the number of vertices in the graph.

An N x N adjacency matrix graph, where:

graph[i][j] = 1 if there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j.
graph[i][j] = 0 if there is no edge.
A dictionary that maps vertices to labels (for readable output).
